This repository includes the code and data for analyses in the paper: Quantification of the Self-Excited Emotion Dynamics in Online Interactions.
We use a multivariate Hawkes self-excited point process to model and calibrate the temporal expressions of six basic emotions in YouTube live chats.

The code covers data collection, transformer finetuning for emotion detection, data processing, parametrizing video influence, calibrating the multivariate Hawkes process, and creating figures in our analysis.
The uploaded data is the final dataset for analysis, including 92,412 live chat messages across 397 videos, and the corresponding video transcripts.
